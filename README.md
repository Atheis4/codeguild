#PDX Code Guild

**Intro**

The following repo contains projects and assignments from the twelve-week, full-time, intensive computer programming bootcamp, PDX Code Guild.

The course taught python-based, full-stack web application development.

I've divided my assignments into two broad categories: [front end](/frontend/) and [python](/python/).

The other folders that exist at this top level are self contained django web-apps implementing both front and backend development.

I am currently in the process of cleaning up and notating these projects more fully.

**Django Web-apps**

1. [Book Stats](/book_stats/) - a simple web app that builds off of a previous assignment to allow users to search for a word in Alice and Wonderland and get a simple statistical analysis of its frequency in the book.
2. [Flutter](/flutter/) - basic clone of twitter-style web app. Allows visitors to post flutts, search recent flutts by keyword or user, while expanding my knowledge of django models and querying a sqlite3 database.
3. [Jokes](/jokes/) - input a joke setup and punchline and post to database. Jokes are rendered and given interactivity on index page.
4. [MadLib](/madlib_web/) - group assignment to introduce query arguments and further knowledge of HTTP requests.
5. [Polls](/polls/) - simple django-based, web-poll inquiring about favorite ice cream flavors.
6. [Sub Todo](/sub_todo/) - django web-app that allows users to create different to-do lists and add items to each of the lists. Introduction to the power of django's templating abilities.

**Addendum**

[Rotate Image](/rotate_image/) - non-django project to introduce virtual environments.

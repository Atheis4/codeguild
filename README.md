#PDX Code Guild

**Intro**

The following repo contains projects and assignments from the twelve-week, full-time, intensive computer programming bootcamp, PDX Code Guild.

The course taught python-based, full-stack web application development.

I've divided my assignments into two broad categories: [frontend](/frontend/) and [python](/python/). The other folders that exist at this top level are self contained django web-apps implementing both front and backend development.

I am currently in the process of cleaning up and notating these projects more fully.

        <div><p>Even as Vera Rubin and her galaxy-motion-measuring colleagues in the 1970s were converging on the evidence for "missing mass" and prompting cosmologists to ask the inevitable question What is it?, parallel developments in particle physics were coincidentally coming up with a possible answer: Not the stuff of us.</p></div>
        <div><p>Not the stuff of atoms—the protons and neutrons, collectively called baryons, that have been forming and re-forming familiar matter from the first instant of the universe. Other stuff instead, also left over from the first instants of the universe, but not forming and re-forming, not interacting with itself or any other matter. </p></div>
        <div><p>Stuff that was weighing down the universe just by being there in abundance, but not doing much else. In the 1970s theorists were coming up with these hypothetical particles by the bushel in an effort to solve some problems with the standard model of particle physics.</p></div>

        <p>How do you see something that is dark, if by "dark" you mean, as astronomers beginning in the 1970s and 1980s did, "impossible to see"? How do you do something that is, by your own definition, impossible to do? You don't. You rethink the question.</p>
        <p>For thousands of years, astronomers had tried to apprehend the workings of the universe by looking at the lights in the sky. Then, starting with Galileo, they learned to look for more lights in the sky, those that they couldn't see with their eyes alone but that they could see through a telescope. By the middle of the twentieth century, they were expanding their understanding of "light," looking through telescopes that saw beyond the optical parts of the electromagnetic spectrum—radio waves, infrared radiation, x-rays, and so on.</p>
        <p>After the acceptance of evidence for dark matter, astronomers realized they would need to expand their understanding of "look." Now, if they wanted to apprehend the workings of the universe, they would have to learn to look in a broader sense of the word: to seek, somehow. To come into some manner of contact with. Otherwise, they could do only what ancient astronomers had been compelled to do, in the absence of instruments that extended one of the five senses: Save the appearances. Think. Theorize.</p>
